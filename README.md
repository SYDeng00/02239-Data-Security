# Project Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a series of tasks aimed at enhancing a prototype print server developed in our Authentication lab. The main focus is to implement and enforce an access control policy via an access control list (ACL) and subsequently through Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
